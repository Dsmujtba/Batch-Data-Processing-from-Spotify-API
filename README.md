# Batch Data Processing from Spotify API

This project demonstrates how to perform **batch data processing** from the Spotify API. The goal is to extract data about new album releases and their tracks, store it locally, and prepare it for further analysis. This pipeline is designed to support marketing analysts in understanding music trends and their potential correlation with product sales.

## Project Overview

This project is a **batch data processing pipeline** that interacts with the Spotify API to:
1. Fetch new album releases.
2. Extract track information for each album.
3. Store the data in a structured format (JSON) for further analysis.

The pipeline is designed to handle **authentication**, **pagination**, and **token expiration**, ensuring reliable and scalable data ingestion.

---

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Uses OAuth2 to authenticate with the Spotify API.
- **Pagination**: Handles pagination to fetch all available data.
- **Token Management**: Automatically refreshes the access token when it expires.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes data in batches and stores it locally.
- **Modular Design**: Separates concerns into different files (`main.py`, `endpoints.py`, `authentication.py`) for better maintainability.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Spotify Developer Account (to get `Client ID` and `Client Secret`)
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- `python-dotenv` library (`pip install python-dotenv`)

### Steps
1. **Create a Spotify App**:
   - Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
   - Create a new app and note down the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
     CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

5. **Output**:
   - The pipeline will create a JSON file (`album_items_<DATETIME>.json`) in the `src/` directory containing the extracted data.

---

## File Descriptions

- **`env`**: Stores environment variables (`CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`) for secure authentication.
- **`main.py`**: The main script that orchestrates the pipeline. It fetches album IDs and then retrieves track information for each album.
- **`endpoints.py`**: Contains functions to interact with the Spotify API, including pagination and token refresh logic.
- **`authentication.py`**: Handles the OAuth2 authentication process to obtain an access token.

---

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**:
   - The `authentication.py` file uses the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to fetch an access token from Spotify.

2. **Fetching New Releases**:
   - The `main.py` script calls the `get_paginated_new_releases` function from `endpoints.py` to fetch all new album releases.

3. **Fetching Album Tracks**:
   - For each album ID, the `get_paginated_album_tracks` function is called to fetch the tracks.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - The extracted data is saved in a JSON file with a timestamped filename to avoid overwriting.

---

## Best Practices

### 1. **Secure Credentials**
   - Always store sensitive information like `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in environment variables (`.env` file) and never hardcode them in the code.

### 2. **Modular Design**
   - Separate concerns into different files (e.g., `authentication.py`, `endpoints.py`) to make the codebase easier to maintain and test.

### 3. **Pagination**
   - Handle pagination to ensure all data is fetched. Use the `next` URL or `offset` and `limit` parameters provided by the API.

### 4. **Token Management**
   - Implement token refresh logic to handle token expiration. This ensures the pipeline can run for extended periods without interruption.

### 5. **Error Handling**
   - Add robust error handling for API requests, including retries for failed requests and logging for debugging.

### 6. **Batch Processing**
   - Use batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently. Avoid loading all data into memory at once.

### 7. **Logging**
   - Add logging to track the progress of the pipeline and identify issues. For example:
     ```python
     import logging
     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
     ```

### 8. **Automation**
   - Schedule the pipeline to run periodically (e.g., daily) using tools like `cron` or Apache Airflow.

### 9. **Data Validation**
   - Validate the extracted data to ensure it meets expected formats and contains no missing or corrupted values.

### 10. **Documentation**
   - Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for the pipeline, including setup instructions, file descriptions, and best practices.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Implement a streaming pipeline to process data in real-time using tools like Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.

2. **Data Enrichment**:
   - Enrich the Spotify data with additional information, such as genre, mood, or popularity metrics.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Store the extracted data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for easier querying and analysis.

4. **Dashboard**:
   - Build a dashboard (e.g., using Tableau or Power BI) to visualize music trends and their correlation with product sales.

5. **Scalability**:
   - Use cloud services (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) to scale the pipeline for larger datasets.
